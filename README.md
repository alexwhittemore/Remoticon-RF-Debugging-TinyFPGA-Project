# Remoticon-RF-Debugging-TinyFPGA-Project

Demo firmware to go along with the Hackaday Remoticon Basics of RF Emissions Debugging workshop: https://hackaday.io/project/175080-remoticon-basics-of-rf-emissions-debugging

** IF YOU'RE DOING THE WORKSHOP, DON'T READ THE CODE! **
It doesn't REALLY matter, but the idea is to sniff out what the firmware does FIRST, then go ahead and make modifications to see how they change things.
I WAS going to make a pre-compiled binary to upload, but I've decided it's probably too complicated to walk through it during an already-complicated workshop that MOST people will already be underprepared for :)

1. Install the TinyFPGA toolchain for the TinyFPGA BX from https://tinyfpga.com/bx/guide.html
2. Clone this repo to your machine
3. Open Atom, and then File>open the cloned directory
4. With the TinyFPGA BX plugged in, click the APIO Upload button!
